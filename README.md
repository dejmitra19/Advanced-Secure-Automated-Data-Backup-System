# Advanced-Secure-Automated-Data-Backup-System
# Project Title: Advanced Secure Automated Data Backup System

## Project Summary

This advanced project focuses on creating a robust and secure automated data backup system using PowerShell scripting and Azure Storage. It integrates advanced security features such as multi-factor authentication and implements secure key management for encryption.

## Languages Used

- PowerShell

## Environments Used

- Windows 10
- Azure

## Technology/Applications/Services Used

- Azure Storage
- Azure Key Vault

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Integration

1. Configure MFA for Azure Storage access.
2. Document the steps to enable MFA in the Azure portal.
   - Include screenshots if needed.

### Step 2: Key Management with Azure Key Vault

1. Create an Azure Key Vault.
2. Store encryption keys securely in the Key Vault.
3. Modify the PowerShell script to retrieve encryption keys from Azure Key Vault.
   - Include screenshots if needed.

### Step 3: Secure Data Transfer Implementation

1. Enhance the PowerShell script to use secure data transfer protocols (e.g., HTTPS).
2. Document the modifications made to the script for secure data transfer.
   - Include relevant code snippets.

### Step 4: Security Auditing Configuration

1. Configure Azure Storage logging and auditing features.
2. Document the steps to enable and review security logs in Azure Storage.
   - Include screenshots or examples of logs.

### Step 5: Error Handling and Notifications

1. Modify the PowerShell script to handle errors gracefully.
2. Implement notifications in case of backup failures.
3. Document the error handling mechanisms.
   - Include relevant code snippets.

### Step 6: Documentation on Security Measures

1. Create detailed documentation in the repository outlining security measures and their significance.
2. Include information on MFA, key management, secure data transfer, auditing, and error handling.
   - Use markdown for clear formatting.
